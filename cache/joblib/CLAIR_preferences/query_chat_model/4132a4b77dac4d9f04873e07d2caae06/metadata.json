{"duration": 38.39839792251587, "input_args": {"user_prompt": "'You are a teacher and your task is to minimally improve a student\\'s answer. I will give you a {task} and a {student_solution}. Your job is to revise the {student_solution} such that it is clearer, more correct, and more engaging. Copy all non-corrected parts of the student\\'s answer. Do not allude to the {corrected_student_solution} being a revision or a correction in your final solution.\\n\\n{task}: Suppose you are a content creator and want to generate compelling titles and descriptions for your YouTube videos automatically. You have decided to use GPT to solve this problem.\\nCan you provide an example of how you would use GPT to generate titles and descriptions for your YouTube videos automatically? Please include the necessary steps and any additional information that may be helpful.\\n\\n{student_solution}: To use GPT for generating compelling titles and descriptions for your YouTube videos automatically, you can follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Choose a GPT model: First, you\\'ll need to decide which GPT model to use. OpenAI\\'s GPT-3 is the most advanced version of the transformer-based language model, and you can use its API to generate content.\\n\\n2. Sign up for an API key: Access the GPT-3 model through OpenAI\\'s API, so sign up for an account on the OpenAI platform (https://beta.openai.com/signup/) and get an API key.\\n\\n3. Install necessary libraries: To connect with the OpenAI API, you may need Python programming language and some libraries like \\'openai\\' and \\'requests.\\' You can install them using pip:\\n\\n```\\npip install openai requests\\n```\\n\\n4. Prepare your input: Make a list of video topics or keywords that you want the GPT model to use as context for generating titles and descriptions. You could also provide additional context, like specifying your target audience or industry.\\n\\n5. Set up your Python script: Write a Python script that sends requests to the GPT-3 API with your input and desired output format. Here is a sample Python script:\\n\\n```python\\nimport openai\\nimport requests\\nimport json\\n\\n# Replace \\'your-api-key\\' with your actual API key\\napi_key = \\'your-api-key\\'\\nopenai.api_key = api_key\\n\\n# Set up GPT-3 API endpoint and headers\\nurl = \\'https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/davinci-codex/completions\\'\\nheaders = {\\n    \\'Content-Type\\': \\'application/json\\',\\n    \\'Authorization\\': f\\'Bearer {api_key}\\',\\n}\\n\\n# Define your prompt\\ninput_text = \\'Generate a title and description for a YouTube video about iPhone tips and tricks for beginners.\\'\\n\\n# Set up API payload\\ndata = {\\n    \\'prompt\\': f\\'{input_text}\\',\\n    \\'max_tokens\\': 50,  # Limit the response to 50 tokens\\n    \\'n\\': 1,  # Number of completions\\n    \\'stop\\': None,  # Any token you want the API to stop generating at\\n    \\'temperature\\': 0.8,  # A balance between creative and focused outputs (lower for more focused, higher for more creative)\\n    \\'top_p\\': 1,  # The top probability ratio\\n}\\n\\n# Send the request and get the response\\nresponse = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))\\nresult = response.json()\\n\\n# Extract title and description\\ngenerated_text = result[\\'choices\\'][0][\\'text\\'].strip().split(\\'\\\\n\\')\\n\\ntitle = generated_text[0]\\ndesc = generated_text[1]\\n\\nprint(\"Title: \" + title)\\nprint(\"Description: \" + desc)\\n```\\n\\n6. Execute the script: Run the script to generate the title and description. You may modify the input text to generate outputs for other video topics.\\n\\n7. Save the results: You can now use the generated titles and descriptions for your YouTube videos. You may want to fine-tune, validate, or manually approve the generated content to ensure quality and relevance. Store this information in a database or a spreadsheet, or use YouTube\\'s API to upload them directly to your videos.\\n\\nRemember, GPT-3 has limits on the response length (i.e., tokens), so you might need to optimize the output format to avoid exceeding the limit. Also, different API parameters, like temperature and top_p, can affect the results, so feel free to experiment with these to find the best balance between creativity and relevance.\\n\\n-----------------\\n\\nLet\\'s first think step by step with a {teacher_reasoning} to decide how to improve the {student_solution}, then give the {corrected_student_solution}. Mention the {teacher_reasoning} and {corrected_student_solution} identifiers to structure your answer.\\n\\n'", "system_prompt": "''", "url": "'https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions'", "model_name": "'gpt-4-0125-preview'"}, "time": 1723068050.9157221}
