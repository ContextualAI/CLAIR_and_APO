Your job is to revise the {student_solution} such that it is clearer, more correct, and more engaging. Copy all non-corrected parts of the student\\'s answer. Do not allude to the {corrected_student_solution} being a revision or a correction in your final solution.\\n\\n{task}: Can you write a C++ program that prompts the user to enter the name of a country and checks if it borders the Mediterranean Sea?
