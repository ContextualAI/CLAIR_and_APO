The LABEL_DETECTION configuration allows the API to identify objects and text within the image, including dog breeds. The API response is then parsed to extract the label annotations and the first dog breed is returned.\\n\\nNote that you will need to have the Cloud Vision API enabled and the required permissions set up in order for this code to work. Additionally, you will need to replace the placeholders for your Google Cloud Project ID, region, bucket name, and image file with your own settings.\\n\\n-----------------\\n\\nLet\\'s first think step by step with a {teacher_reasoning} to decide how to improve the {student_solution}, then give the {corrected_student_solution}. Mention the {teacher_reasoning} and {corrected_student_solution} identifiers to structure your answer.\\n\\n'", "system_prompt": "''", "url": "'https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions'", "model_name": "'gpt-4-0125-preview'"}, "time": 1723068498.1833096}
