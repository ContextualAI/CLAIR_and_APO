You need to provide a step-by-step explanation, including the calculations necessary to obtain the correct output. To make it more challenging, you are only allowed to use logical reasoning and cannot use any arithmetic operations or variables (e.g. n, sqrt5, phi, psi) directly. Additionally, you need to use a table of values to assist you in generating the Fibonacci numbers. The table contains the values for the first 10 Fibonacci numbers, which can be used as a reference to generate the remaining 10 numbers.

Here\\'s how you can modify the C++ code to generate the first 20 Fibonacci numbers using the golden ratio formula:\\n1. First, let\\'s define the golden ratio, also known as the golden mean, as (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2. We can use this value to calculate the next two terms in the Fibonacci sequence.\\n2. Next, we can use the table of values for the first 10 Fibonacci numbers to calculate the remaining 10 numbers. Here\\'s how we can do it:\\n   - The first two terms in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1.\\n   - The next two terms are calculated using the golden ratio formula: (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2\\n   - The next six terms are calculated by adding the previous two terms together: (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2 + (1 - sqrt(5)) / 2\\n   - The remaining six terms are calculated by switching the positions of the previous two terms: (1 - sqrt(5)) / 2 + (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2\\n   - Table of values for the first 10 Fibonacci numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34\\n3. Now, we can use the golden ratio formula to calculate the next 10 Fibonacci numbers:\\n   - The first two terms are 0 and 1, just like the first two terms in the sequence.\\n   - The next two terms are calculated using the golden ratio formula: (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2\\n   - The next six terms are calculated by adding the previous two terms together: (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2 + (1 - sqrt(5)) / 2\\n   - The remaining six terms are calculated by switching the positions of the previous two terms: (1 - sqrt(5)) / 2 + (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2\\n4. Finally, we can print out the first 20 Fibonacci numbers using the golden ratio formula:\\n   - Fibonacci number 0 is 0\\n   - Fibonacci number 1 is 1\\n   - Fibonacci number 2 is calculated using the golden ratio formula: (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2\\n   - Fibonacci number 3 is 2\\n   - Fibonacci number 4 is calculated using the golden ratio formula: (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2 + (1 - sqrt(5)) / 2\\n   - Fibonacci number 5 is 3\\n   - Fibonacci number 6 is calculated using the golden ratio formula: (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2 + (1 - sqrt(5)) / 2\\n   - Fibonacci number 7 is 5\\n   - Fibonacci number 8 is calculated using the golden ratio formula: (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2 + (1 - sqrt(5)) / 2\\n   - Fibonacci number 9 is 8\\n   - Fibonacci number 10 is calculated by switching the positions of Fibonacci number 8 and Fibonacci number 2\\n   - Fibonacci number 11 is 13\\n   - Fibonacci number 12 is calculated by switching the positions of Fibonacci number 11 and Fibonacci number 7\\n   - Fibonacci number 13 is 21\\n   - Fibonacci number 14 is calculated by switching the positions of Fibonacci number 13 and Fibonacci number 12\\n   - Fibonacci number 15 is 34\\n   - Fibonacci number 16 is calculated by switching the positions of Fibonacci number 15 and Fibonacci number 14\\n   - Fibonacci number 17 is 55\\n   - Fibonacci number 18 is calculated by switching the positions of Fibonacci number 17 and Fibonacci number 16\\n   - Fibonacci number 19 is 89\\n   - Fibonacci number 20 is calculated by switching the positions of Fibonacci number 19 and Fibonacci number 18\\nAnd there you have it!
