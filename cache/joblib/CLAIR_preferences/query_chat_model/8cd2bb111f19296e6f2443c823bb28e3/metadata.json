Your job is to revise the {student_solution} such that it is clearer, more correct, and more engaging. Copy all non-corrected parts of the student\\'s answer. Do not allude to the {corrected_student_solution} being a revision or a correction in your final solution.\\n\\n{task}: Can you solve this language puzzle? Think about the impact of climate change in a certain region.\\nWhat word becomes a palindrome when you add three letters to it? \\nTo help you solve it, consider the average temperature increase in the region over the past few years. Use the following array of temperature values to calculate the average temperature increase per year: \\nlet temperatures = [24, 26, 27, 29, 31, 33, 36, 35, 33, 30, 28, 25]; \\nAs the temperature continues to rise, words are getting shorter and shorter. Can you figure out the word that fits this description?\\n\\n{student_solution}: The word is \"bottle\", which is a palindrome when you add three letters (t, e, a). To calculate the average temperature increase per year, we can use the formula \u0394T = T2 - T1, where T1 and T2 are the temperatures of two subsequent years. In this case, the calculated average temperature increase is 3.5\u00b0C (24-20.5\u00b0C = 3.5\u00b0C).\\n\\n-----------------\\n\\nLet\\'s first think step by step with a {teacher_reasoning} to decide how to improve the {student_solution}, then give the {corrected_student_solution}. Mention the {teacher_reasoning} and {corrected_student_solution} identifiers to structure your answer.\\n\\n'", "system_prompt": "''", "url": "'https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions'", "model_name": "'gpt-4-0125-preview'"}, "time": 1723068222.964679}
